## fcc-drum-machine

`General Goal:`

Create a drum machine which will work and look similarly to one created [here](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/MJyNMd).
The machine will have to pass tests set out by fcc, which are supplied through a CDN link in HTML.

`Additionally:`

- I will create section with background melodies to enhance the drum machine.

`Restrictions / Tools:`
- Use test driven development (Jest, Enzyme)
- Use React to develop the application
- Style the application using SASS
